- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @phedlund113
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in C, python (crack language) woodturning, woodworking
- ðŸ“« How to reach me p_hedlund@hotmail.com

I have been a programmer for almost 40 years. My bread and butter language is 'c' however my crack language (writing utilities and such)
is python. I am currently using python 3.7. 
During my career I have been fortunate to be helped by friends and members of different clubs. (both computer and woodturning). I 
would like to share what I have learned with others. 

My only request would be if you use my code, give me credit.
